  <dd>It is possible, in Dotclear 2, to specify in the configuration <em>(PATH)</em>
  many paths of folders containing plugins. But, the plugin update are done only in
  the <strong>last folder specify</strong> in <em>PATH</em>.
  You may have, for several reasons, in other folders, an older plugin than currently 
  available on DotAddict. <strong>In this case</strong>, you have two choices: <ul>

  <li><strong>Autorize</strong> multi-installation: the newer version of the
  plugin will be downloaded and installed in the last folder of <em>PATH</em>
  and the older one will be disabled (a _disabled file will be created in his folder). This 
  old version <strong>will not be deleted</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Not autorize</strong> multi-installation : the newer version will overwrite
  the older one.</li></ul>

  By default, <strong>multi-installation is disabled</strong> but you can change
  this behaviour by modifying the <em>dainstaller_allow_multi_install</em> variable
  in <a href="?p=aboutConfig">about:config</a></dd>
