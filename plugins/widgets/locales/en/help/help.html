<h4>Use of widgets</h4>

<p>Widgets may be used to add various blocks of content to be displayed on your public pages. To add a widget, drag it from the Available widgets list on the left to one of the sidebars on the right of this page. You can order your widgets in a sidebar by dragging them up or down. You must update sidebars to apply your changes.</p>

<p>Once included in a sidebar, widgets have configuration options that you can reach by clicking on the arrow next to their name.</p>

<p>Reset sidebars to get back to default widgets installation</p>

<h4>Widget templates tags</h4>

<div id="widgets-tpl">

<p>If you are allowed to edit your theme templates, you can directly add widgets as templates tags, with their own configuration.</p>

<p>To add a widget in your template, you need to write code like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;tpl:Widget id="<strong>Widget ID</strong>"&gt;
  &lt;setting name="<strong>Setting name</strong>"&gt;<strong>Setting value</strong>&lt;/setting&gt;
  ...
&lt;/tpl:Widget&gt;
</pre>
