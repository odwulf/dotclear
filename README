WHAT YOU NEED TO RUN DOTCLEAR
-----------------------------
In order to run Dotclear you need:

 * A web server (Apache, Cheerokee, lightHttpd, etc.)
 * PHP 5.2 with the following modules:
   * mbstring
   * iconv
   * simplexml
   * mysql, postgresql or sqlite
 * A database server (MySQL or PostgreSQL) or SQLite.


INSTALLATION
------------
Copy inc/config.php.in to inc/config.php and fill in the fields with appropriate
values.

If you intend to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you'll have to create a database
first. With SQLite, db/ folder will have to be writable by your web server.
